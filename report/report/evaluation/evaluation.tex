This chapter will evaluate and discuss how successful the design and implementation is at meeting the proposed requirements for the project. To do this, the chapter will discuss how the protocol performs in general followed by a comparison of the efficiency of the protocol and its implementation in comparison to other systems discussed in chapter \ref{cha:background}.

\section{Implementation size and performance} % (fold)
\label{sec:implementation_size_and_performance}
Discuss size of protocol implementation and general performance.

\section{Comparison to other systems} % (fold)
\label{sec:comparison_to_other_systems}

\subsection{xAP - Receiving packets} % (fold)
\label{sub:xap}
calculate number of packets received by one node for both systems in a typical scenario, as the network expands to support 5, 10, 25 50, 100, 200 nodes.

\subsection{JMS - Failure} % (fold)
\label{sub:jms_failure}
Discuss how system can withstand failures
