\chapter{Introduction}
\pagenumbering{arabic}

The ``Internet of Things'' paradigm along with the ``Smart'' prefix has recently seen a huge increase in interest and popularity with manufacturers, hobbyists and end-users. Everything from your set-top box to your washing machine\cite{LG} can now be ``Smart''\cite{SmartCraze} and connect to the Internet to tell you if your favourite TV show has downloaded or that your wash cycle has complete. Some hobbyists have gone so far to make plants send a text or tweet when it needs watering\cite{TweetPlant}.

This uptake in interest and development can be largely attributed to the advent of lower power, smaller and most importantly cheaper devices. Large companies such as the mobile phone chip-set manufacturer, Qualcomm, recently declared their support at CES 2012 with the announcement of a dedicated development platform for the ``Internet of Things''\cite{Qualcomm}.

Similarly there has also been much enthusiasm from the small companies and start ups trying to create the next hit consumer device. Social funding platform, Kickstarter\cite{Kickstarter}, has seen many attempts at creating the perfect ``Thing'' for the Internets\cite{SmartThings}\cite{Twine}.

Whilst all of these devices from manufacturers, start ups and hobbyists may very well be great ``Things'' by themselves, there exists a problem. How do you connect all these heterogeneous platforms and devices together to create a true ``Internet of Things''?

This project focuses on just that and endeavours to create a communication protocol that is not only platform agnostic but also lightweight enough to be run on the most brain-dead constrained devices, such as the TelosB Sky Motes(8MHz,10K ram)\cite{TelosB}. Another design focus is that the protocol must be able to scale well as the network dramatically increases and decreases in size.
