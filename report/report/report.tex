\title{A lightweight protocol for constrained devices for use in the Internet of Things paradigm}
\author{Fergus W. Leahy}
\date{\today}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
With the advent of cheap, low-power and small devices, it becomes possible to embed these devices within our everyday surroundings, to create an always connected, sensing and reacting ``Internet of Things'', with the purpose of not only simplifying our lives but also saving energy at the same time. 

But in order to achieve devices of such size, the resources available is restricted. Because of this, current protocols for connecting traditional devices together simply don't cater for the constraints of such devices, therefore a new protocol which understands the constraints of these devices and is designed around this ``Internet of Things'' revolution is necessary.

To design the protocol, a wide variety of existing/developing protocols and systems were reviewed, noting what worked well and what didn't; from this a new protocol which could not only run on constrained devices but also scale up to more powerful devices, whilst still taking into consideration reliability, fault tolerance and network scalability/performance.

The new protocol was implemented on the TelosB motes, which provided a benchmark for constrained devices, proving it's possible to create an ``Internet of Things'' protocol which can suitably run on constrained devices, whilst still providing the functionality, reliability and scalability required.

I would like thank to Prof. Joseph Sventek for seeing something in this project from when it was only a seedling of an idea, and for his invaluable support, advice and guidance throughout.

\noindent I would also like to thank my family, girlfriend and all the friends I've come to know in Computing for helping keep me sane and on track throughout the past 4 years.
